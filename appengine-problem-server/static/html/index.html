	<h1>Hey, you've landed in the web equivalent of a desert.</h1>
	<h3>There's actually nothing to see here.</h3>
	<p>This is a server that hosts a few web problem systems for PirateCTF.</p>
	<p>There's actually nothing for you to do on this site except for its suburls, which contain the problems of your interest. You'll find these suburls if you go and look under the "Problems" page on <a href = "https://piratectf.com/">piratectf.com</a>. You will have to create an account and join a team in order to view the problems.</p>
	<p>If you're on a recon problem and are direly convinced that there's something of your interest on this page, feel free to snoop around.</p>
	<!-- Hey good thing you chose to snoop around in the source code. No flag here, but I'm sure eating a few cookies will help you out on your quest for the flag.-->
