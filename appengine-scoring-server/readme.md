This is the part you're probably most concerned with if you're looking to host a CTF. 

If you want to quickstart, all you have to do is edit the parameters of your choosing in main.py, and most things will work on their own. Styling is pretty simple; templates are found in the `html` folder and all the includes (navbar, css, js, etc.) are all found in the `static` folder.
