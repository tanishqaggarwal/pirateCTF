Problem Name: I Hope You Know ASM

A basic exercise in reading some x86 assembly. The assembly will initially populate some registers with a few integer values and do some complicated things with them. Essentially, its shifting bits around so that when combined, the three registers will contain "asm\x00", "_is\x00" "_ez\x00".
